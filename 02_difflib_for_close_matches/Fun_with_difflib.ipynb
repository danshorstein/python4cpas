    "# Module Highlight - difflib\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my first Module Highlight! These posts will be shorter, focused posts with a goal of highlighting and providing useuful examples of a module that I like. <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html\" target=\"_blank\">Difflib</a> is a built-in Python module that does quite a few things, but we will focus mainly on one of its features: the ability to find close matches to inputs. Difflib can be used to compare things such as sentences, lists, files, etc., but my favorite thing about it is the get_close_matches function, which looks for a match between the first input, which is one word or phrase, and the second input, which is a list of words or phrases. <br/><br/>\n",
    "For you Excel-oriented folks, this is like doing a vlookup that finds matches even if the two items don't match exactly. I can't count how many times I've been frustrated trying to do a vlookup and not find any matches, only to discover there's an extra space in one of the words, or one cell is a number and the other is treated text, and sometimes it's just that a word is misspelled. <br/><br/>\n",
    "This is where difflib.get_close_matches function is awesome! Let's look at an example to really understand how great it is. \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "### We will be looking at elements of a few other modules as part of this post:\n",
    "While the main focus is on using difflib, I am using a few other modules and wanted to give them a shoutout:<br/><br/>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jupyter Notebook</a> - This post, and many future posts, will use a fantastic tool called Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter notebook allows you to write Python and documentation in your web browser, and you can run each line of code individually to see how it works, and tweak it. I won't go into any details about how to use it in this post, but see <a href=\"http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html\" >these instructions</a> if you want to learn how to start it up, and play around with a Jupyter Notebook. Otherwise, you can do all of this example in IDLE.</li><br/>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" target=\"_blank\">Faker</a> - This is a cool library that you can use to generate sample data such as names of inviduals and companies, addresses, socials, phone numbers, emails, etc. I'm using it in this post to generate most of the sample data, consisting of names, companies, and addresses.</li><br/>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html\" target=\"_blank\">Collections</a> - specifically the namedtuple function with Collections. Namedtuple makes reading and using codea easier by letting you call tuples by their descriptive name rather than using the location (e.g. employee.name versus employee[0]). This is a more advanced topic, so I won't go into it much in this post, but just know that I'm using it and you should check it out if you want.</li>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html\" target=\"_blank\">CSV</a> - This is a very handy module for accountants that lets python read and save to CSV files. It's really useful, and you'll see a lot of it in future posts.\n",

    "# Example use of DIfflib - Comparing two lists of addresses\n",
    "One common internal/external audit procedure I've done is to compare a list of employee addresses to vendor payment addresses. This can be done using data analytic software, but it's not as easily done with Excel. There is more than one way to do this, but difflib provides an easy way by using its get_close_matches. For this example, I've created a fake list of employees and a fake list of companies. I used a python library called faker to do this, then for purposes of this exercise, I manually adjusted a few of the addresses so some would be close but not equal matches between the two lists, so we could see if they are picked up by difflib. I've included the steps I took to create and save these fake lists at the end of this post in case you want to see how it was done.\n",

We will be iterating over the list of employee addresses and comparing each to each of the vendor addresses, therefore we have to pass that item in as a list (we do so by putting it in [brackets]). The reason we are passing in each address individually rather than as a list, is so we can return the full name and address rather than just the matching address. It takes a little bit longer to do it this way, so if you're dealing with loads more records, it may be more efficient to find the potential matches first, and look up the names after.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the function we need to adjust is the <b>cutoff</b>. The cutoff represents a number between 0 and 1, and is the cutoff where if the matching score of the two words is not ABOVE the cutoff point, then it is ignored. I tried a few different cutoffs, and finally came to .8 as an appropriate cutoff for our case. 0.7 included too many potential matches, but 0.9 didn't include enough. Use your judgment here.\n",
